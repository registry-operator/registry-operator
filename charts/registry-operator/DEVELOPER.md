# How to maintain the helm chart

1. the `make` command `helm-crd` and `helm-readme` should be ran before a release
1. after it should be reviewed for any changes
1. save and commit the changes

## `helm-init` make command

This is left to show the helm chart was generated, it does not need to be re-ran as it will destroy and manual changes
