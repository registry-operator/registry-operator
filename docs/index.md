Welcome to Registry Operator's documentation portal! Here, you'll find everything you need, whether you're a beginner getting started with container registries or an experienced user looking for advanced operational features.

The **Registry Operator** simplifies the management of your container registry, automating tasks such as scaling, updates, and backups, allowing you to focus more on your application development and less on operational overhead. It provides seamless integration with Kubernetes, utilizing **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** and **Operator pattern** to ensure the health and scalability of your registry infrastructure.

## What is the Distribution Registry?

The **Distribution Registry**, often simply called the **Registry**, is a stateless, highly scalable server-side application that stores and distributes container images and other content.[^1] It's a core component of the container ecosystem, allowing you to push, pull, and manage container images efficiently across environments. With **Registry Operator**, managing this core service becomes easier, more automated, and scalable.

## Key Features of Registry Operator

- **Automated Lifecycle Management:** The operator manages the lifecycle of your container registry, from installation and configuration to updates and maintenance.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):** Leverage Kubernetes-native resources to define and manage your registry instances.
- **Easy Installation and Configuration:** With simple installation steps and clear configuration options, setting up a registry is fast and efficient.
